# H2Pack-Matlab

This is the Matlab prototype for our published [H2Pack package](https://github.com/huanghua1994/H2Pack)

## Getting Started

1. run "compile.m" in the root directory in Matlab to compile several necessary mex files. 
2. example_\*.m files explain the basic usage of all functions, and can be easily modified for personal use. 

## Note
In this matlab version, kernel evaluation and proxy point selection are poorly optimized and can be more time consuming than constructing and applying H2 matrix representations. For fully optimized performance, please consider using H2Pack.
